Coursera project

The script "run_analysis.R" cleans the activity tracking data and extract the mean and std values. Then summarised the data by taking the average of the measurements by subject and activity type.

In order to run the script "run_analysis.R", the following tables need to be stored in the work folder:
subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, Y_train.txt, subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, Y_test.txt, features.txt

The CodeBook.md includes the list of the variables in the output file.
