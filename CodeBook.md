In the run_analysis.R file mean and std variables are selected from features list based on the variable names (search for mean and std) and the average is applied to all selected columns using ddply function.
Please see the comments in run_analysis.R file for details.
The output file "summary.csv" includes the average values of the selected mean and std variables per subject per activity.
Thanks.
