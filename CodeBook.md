In the script file "run_analysis.R", the activity tracking data is read and then the average and standard deviation variables are selected from features list. The selection is automated based on the variable names (search for mean and std). After subsetting the data and the average calculations is applied to all selected columns using ddply function.
The output file "summary.txt" includes the average values of the selected mean and std variables per subject per activity. The name of the variables are given below. Please see the comments in "run_analysis.R" file for more details.
